# att(x)

Attempt Technologies Company, or, **att(x)** is a group of determined, versatile and lightning fast developers with an objective to build good things others need.

## The Philosophy

Originally, [Luq](https://github.com/luqmanually) (the founder) wanted to name this "att(c)", however, as you may have guessed - it sounds very similar to the freelance platform Etsy. Hence the x. **att** is the acronym of Attemt, which is the alternative spelling of "Attempt". X is in brackets to represent a Python function - that is, our main objective is to execute our role (or function).
